# Debugging-ProjectesProgramacio1

This is a project where we use debbuging programs like Valgrind and GDB to debug a program given that was full of bugs and now,
the majority of them are solved. This program is related with traveling destinations. It has multiple options:

1. Show all destinations: Shows a list with all the travelling destinations previously loaded with a .nymal file. This list is 
  sorted according to the option selected by the user. This sorted options can be:
    1. By name
		2. By average price
		3. By distance
		4. By time

2. Plan a trip: Shows all destinations and the user has to select one.Then the user is given an other menu, with more options 
   to select:
   
     1. Show best hotels: With this option the program can show the user, the prices of the best hotels , 
     (we thought that the best hotels were the cheaper ones), and it also shows the average of all hotels in that area.
	  
    2. Show best altitude route
                so the program can show him prices of the best 
                hotels , (we thought that the best hotels were the cheaper ones), and the average of all hotels in that area.

3. Load a different DB: You can run the program, with another database. So option gives the user, the ability to run the same
   program with a diferent database.
